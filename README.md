# Scrappy
This repo hosts scraping for twitter as well as rss feeds

Currently this scraper relies on tweepy v4.4.0 and you only need the essential twitter developer account.

As for the rss it needs feedparser v6.0.8, but at the moment it only works with one rss feed at a time unlike twitter where you can scrape more than an account at the same time.

The only requirement is to change all the api keys and insert your own ones in the `keys.py` folder located in the directory.
